## Zezzar'Myr Barrimtor

**Zezzar'Myr Barrimtor**, better known as **Zezzar**, is an enigma wrapped within the folds of nature. He is a Simic Ranger, his soul interwoven with the very essence of the wilderness. From the murmur of the rivers to the whispers of the leaves, nature resonates within him. Yet, it is his insatiable curiosity and fascination with the complex ballet of life that sets him apart from others.

As a young boy, Zezzar stumbled upon a group of innovative savants known as the Biomancers. This guild, pioneers in a field they coined as "Evolutionism," cleverly fused the raw, primal elements of magic with the cerebral precision of technology. Their aim was to orchestrate a form of controlled evolution, the seamless blend of nature's wonders with the practicalities of modern advancements. Intrigued by their audacious ideology, Zezzar spent several years absorbing their knowledge like a sponge.

His involvement with the Biomancers led him to volunteer for a groundbreaking endeavor known as "The Echidna Project". The project was hinged on the use of a unique substance - the GeneOoze. It was this mysterious compound that held the potential to blur the lines between species, to graft the capabilities of one creature onto another, creating hybrids that bore the best of multiple worlds.

Zezzar, enthralled by the prospects of this project, eagerly signed up. He saw this as an opportunity to bring about a new era of harmony between different species, a step closer to the perfect symbiosis he envisioned.

However, the GeneOoze was a finite resource. It was originally discovered in a shipwreck off the Sword Coast, but the supply had long since been exhausted. To continue the project, more was needed, and it was Zezzar who was entrusted with this mission. Now, Zezzar is on a quest, a quest not just for the elusive GeneOoze, but for the fulfillment of a dream that could reshape the world. His path is filled with unknown perils, but his fascination for nature and the prospect of evolutionary breakthroughs fuels his resolve.

## Skippy Arledge

**Skippy Arledge** is a warrior in the skin of a hare, or rather, a Haregon Paladin. As small as a halfling, yet brimming with courage larger than a giant's heart, Skippy stands (or jumps) as a testament to the old adage - size does not define bravery. Born into nobility, he could have lived a life of comfort and luxury, yet the thrill of danger and allure of heroic tales beckoned him away from the gilded cage of his lineage.

Adventurous and daring, Skippy views life through the prism of a grand adventure book, every turn a new chapter waiting to be written. He loves the rush of adrenaline, the symphony of clashing blades, the blaze of magical explosions. In his world, everything must culminate in a heroic crescendo, the louder and flashier, the better.

His thrill-seeking spirit and noble heart have led him into a life of a mercenary, a career that feeds his craving for action and heroics. But Skippy is not just a thrill-seeker. His daring has a purpose, a noble intent rooted in his Paladin's oath. To him, every mission is an opportunity to bring light into the world, to turn the tides in favor of good, and to end the chapter on a high, heroic note.

Skippy's latest mission is as enigmatic as it is exciting. A new continent has materialized off the Sword Coast, an unexplored land shrouded in swirling mist and mystery. The call of the unknown has echoed in his ears, and Skippy has answered with fervent eagerness. This is not just a mission for him; it's an epic new chapter, waiting to be written in the language of adventure, heroism, and if Skippy has anything to say about it - plenty of spectacular explosions.

## Flint

**Flint** is a man who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, walking a path of redemption with a determination that only emerges from the deepest realms of regret. Once a simple human with dreams woven around the intricacies of wizardry, Flint is a testament to the tragic beauty of unfulfilled ambitions. His early years were spent in the shadowy halls of a wizarding academy, his heart aching for the magic that seemed to elude his grasp. Flint was not naturally gifted in the arcane arts like his peers, yet he held an unwavering resolve to become a wizard. This lack of talent, however, would set him on an unintended journey.

A fateful encounter with a lunar druidic ritual turned his world upside down, granting him powers that he had neither asked for nor understood. In a disastrous moment of curiosity and desperation, Flint interrupted this ritual, causing a catastrophe that would leave a lasting scar on his conscience. Now, Flint is a Lunar Sorcerer, bearing an arcane might that sprang from the moon's mysterious energies. A reluctant hero of sorts, Flint aims to harness these newfound powers not just for personal gain, but to rectify the damage his careless actions caused. He's driven by a deep sense of responsibility, a stark contrast to his prior reckless curiosity.

## Sametir

**Sametir** stands tall as an orc among moons. He is a Druid of the Moon, a solitary figure who found solace in the moon's quiet glow rather than the tumultuous nature of his orcish brethren. His spiritual connection to lunar forces is profound, almost sacred. The night of Flint's fateful intrusion, Sametir was one of the druids enveloped in the ritual that went awry.

Though the ritual was disrupted, causing a ripple of chaotic energy, Sametir found himself empathizing with Flint rather than bearing resentment. Being an outcast himself among his own kind, he understands what it means to be lost, to be different. His solitary nature, though, hides a caring soul; a soul who chose to take the strayed Flint under his wing, rather than cast him out into the cold unknown.

Guiding Flint in managing and understanding his haphazardly gained powers, Sametir hopes to turn the human from a cataclysm's harbinger into a protector of the natural order. In teaching Flint, he is not just imparting wisdom of lunar powers, but perhaps, seeking his own redemption and acceptance. Their lives intertwined by an errant burst of moonlight, Flint and Sametir continue their journey together, bonded by their shared need for redemption, and the moon's mysterious allure.
